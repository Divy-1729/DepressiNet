# Binary Classification Model

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the deep learning model architecture designed for binary classification tasks. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and is optimized for scenarios where the goal is to classify input data into one of two categories (e.g., 0 or 1).

## Overview of the Model

The binary classification model is built to handle 17 input features. It employs multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns in the data. To ensure robustness and prevent overfitting, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are incorporated.

### Key Features:
- **Input Normalization**: Batch normalization is applied to the input features to stabilize and accelerate training.
- **Hidden Layers**: Four dense layers with variable units and dropout rates.
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers mitigate overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with sigmoid activation outputs a probability, which can be thresholded to classify the data into two categories.

## Model Architecture Details

### 1. Input Layer:
- Batch normalization is applied to standardize the 17 input features. This ensures consistent scaling and stabilizes the learning process.

### 2. Hidden Layers:
- **First Layer**:
  - Dense layer with tunable units ranging from 128 to 1024.
  - ReLU activation for non-linearity.
  - Dropout with rates between 0.2 and 0.5 for regularization.
  - Batch normalization.
- **Second Layer**:
  - Dense layer with tunable units ranging from 64 to 512.
  - ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - Batch normalization.
- **Third Layer**:
  - Dense layer with tunable units ranging from 32 to 256.
  - ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - Batch normalization.
- **Fourth Layer**:
  - Dense layer with tunable units ranging from 32 to 128.
  - ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - Batch normalization.

### 3. Output Layer:
- A single neuron with sigmoid activation that outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
- The sigmoid function maps the output to a range suitable for binary classification.

## Training the Model

The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer, with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Accuracy is tracked as the primary performance metric.

### Training Workflow:
1. **Compile the Model**:
   - The model is compiled with the following settings:
     - **Loss Function**: `binary_crossentropy` for comparing predicted probabilities with actual labels.
     - **Optimizer**: `adam` for adaptive learning rate optimization.
     - **Metrics**: Accuracy to evaluate the percentage of correct predictions.

2. **Fit the Model**:
   - The training data is passed to the model, and validation data is used to monitor performance during training.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Hyperparameters such as the number of units in each layer and dropout rates are optimized using Keras Tuner.

## Evaluating the Model

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Loss**: Measures the error between predicted probabilities and true labels.
- **Accuracy**: Tracks the fraction of correctly classified samples.

### Testing:
- The model is tested on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well beyond the training set.

## Making Predictions

Once trained, the model outputs probabilities between 0 and 1 for each sample. These probabilities are thresholded (commonly at 0.5) to classify samples as 0 or 1.

### Post-Processing:
- **Thresholding**: Apply a threshold to convert probabilities to binary predictions.
